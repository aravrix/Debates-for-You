                <b><p>Topic: Do religions cause wars? Are religions the main cause of wars?</p></b>
                <img src="../assets/religion-causes-wars.png" alt="Post Thumbnail">
<p>The discussion centers on whether religion is a cause of war due to leaders claiming divine instruction. One side argues that leaders instigate conflict by asserting they are acting on God's commands, leveraging the belief of the masses in their divine connection. The other side counters that these leaders genuinely believe in the existence of God and the instructions received, suggesting that without such belief, they would not be in positions of power.</p>
<p>The debate then shifts to the definition and transmission of religion. One participant asserts that only religions with divine scriptures (Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism are cited) qualify as true religions. The other argues that divine scriptures are not a prerequisite for a religion, as long as a significant number of people follow a deity. This leads to a discussion on how religious knowledge is passed down, with one side emphasizing the importance of scriptures for intergenerational transmission and the other suggesting oral tradition and beliefs are sufficient.</p>
            <p>The topic of the divine origin of scriptures is also raised. One participant claims that religious texts were written down for posterity, while the other cites the historical account of the Quran's revelation to the illiterate Prophet Muhammad as evidence of divine origin.</p>
