          <div style="margin-top: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);">
            <p><strong>Question:</strong><br>
            If an elder disrespects you (in the sense hits you), on a scale of 1 to 5, how violent would your reaction be (physically or verbally)?<br>
            <em>Note: This question was answered only by individuals aged 10 to 18.</em></p>
    
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-top: 15px;">
              <li><strong>0.0%</strong> | A - 1</li>
              <li><strong>16.7%</strong> | B - 2</li>
              <li><strong>33.3%</strong> | C - 3</li>
              <li><strong>0.0%</strong> | D - 4</li>
              <li><strong>50.0%</strong> | E - 5</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary & Gen-Z/Alpha Perspective</h3>
            <p>More than half of respondents chose the highest level of reaction, signaling a strong desire to respond assertively when boundaries are crossed. This reflects the mindset of today’s youth, who are more expressive, self-aware, and protective of their personal space and dignity.</p>
    
            <p>Unlike previous generations that were often taught to remain silent in front of elders, Gen Z and Gen Alpha emphasize mutual respect. Their reactions are less about violence and more about resisting injustice, even within family structures. They're not just reacting — they’re standing up for themselves.</p>
    
            <p>However, this data also reminds us of the importance of emotional guidance. Strong reactions must be accompanied by emotional intelligence. While speaking up is necessary, learning to do so constructively is equally vital.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
            This poll highlights a shift in mindset: respect must be mutual, and the youth today are no longer willing to quietly endure what they feel is wrong — especially when it affects their mental or physical safety.</p>
