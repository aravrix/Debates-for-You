            <ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #333; margin-left: 0; padding-left: 1.2em; list-style-position: inside;">

            <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
              This survey explored the deeply sensitive and alarming scenario of witnessing abuse by someone powerful. The majorityâ€”<strong>57.1%</strong>â€”chose to <strong>intervene</strong>, highlighting courage and an instinct to protect, even when the perpetrator holds influence.
              <br><br>
              However, a significant <strong>28.6%</strong> admitted they would <strong>do nothing</strong>. This suggests a troubling hesitation, possibly driven by fear of retaliation, societal pressure, or a lack of trust in the system.
              <br><br>
              Only <strong>14.3%</strong> said they would <strong>report</strong> the incident, showing the continued fear many feel when dealing with the powerful. And notably, <strong>0%</strong> said they would confide in someone in their community â€” a sign that even local support structures may not be seen as reliable.
              <br><br>
              This data reflects not just public sentiment, but also the need to empower communities with safe, anonymous channels to report abuse, especially when powerful individuals are involved. Education, protection, and systemic reform are critical to changing this mindset.
