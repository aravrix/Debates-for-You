  <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
    This survey focused on empathy in real-life service delays. Despite the delivery being one hour late, the reasonâ€”a parent having to pick up their two-year-old childâ€”was both urgent and understandable.
    <br><br>
    A split in public reaction emerged: <strong>40%</strong> chose to <strong>accept the order without tipping</strong>, showing passive understanding. Another <strong>40%</strong> still preferred to <strong>complain to the app</strong>, indicating that punctuality and service expectations remain strong, regardless of personal emergencies.
    <br><br>
    Just <strong>20%</strong> responded with empathy and generosity, opting to <strong>accept the order and even offer a tip</strong>. Notably, <strong>0%</strong> selected a hostile response, such as arguing, suggesting that while frustration exists, most users maintain a degree of respect in such situations.
    <br><br>
    This data opens a conversation on how service professionals are treated during human crises, and whether platforms should allow customers to offer compassion through their interfaces.
